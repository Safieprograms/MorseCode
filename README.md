# MorseCode
a program that translates Morse code (from/to) text  
  There are two versions of the program, the first one is written in c and the other in Python 
  the one in Python uses libraries like play sound "to play the morse code when displaying it" and keyboard "to detect if a certain key from the keyboard is being pressed and threading to run more than a task at one time (displaying the morse code and checking if the user is pressing a button to exit)"
